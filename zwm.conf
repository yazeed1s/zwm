; ----------- ZWM Configuration File -------------
;
; This configuration file is used to customize the Zee Window Manager (ZWM) settings.
; It allows you to define window appearance, behavior, and key bindings for various actions.

; Command to run on startup
; Use the exec directive to specify programs that should be started when ZWM is launched.
; For single command: use -> exec = "command"
; You can also specify additional arguments as a list.
exec = ["polybar", "-c", ".config/polybar/config.ini"]

; Available Variables:
; These variables control the appearance and behavior of the window manager.
;
; - border_width: defines the width of the window borders in pixels.
border_width = 2
; - active_border_color: specifies the color of the border for the active (focused) window.
active_border_color = 0x83a598
; - normal_border_color: specifies the color of the border for inactive (unfocused) windows.
normal_border_color = 0x30302f
; - window_gap: sets the gap between windows in pixels.
window_gap = 10
; - virtual_desktops: sets the number of virtual desktops available.
virtual_desktops = 7
; - focus_follow_pointer: If false, the window is focused on click.
;                        If true, the window is focused when the cursor enters it.
focus_follow_pointer = true

; Custom window rules
; Custom window rules allow you to define specific behaviors for windows based on their window class.
;
; Syntax:
; rule = wm_class("window class name"), state(tiled|floated), desktop(1..N)
;
; Explanation:
; - wm_class: The window class name used to identify the window. Use the 'xprop' tool to find the wm_class of a window.
; - state: Specifies whether the window should be tiled or floated.
;   - tiled: The window will be tiled, clearly.
;   - floated: The window will be floated, clearly.
; - desktop: The virtual desktop number where the window should be placed. Use -1 if you do not want to set it to a specific desktop.
;
; Example:
; rule = wm_class("firefox"), state(tiled), desktop(-1)
; This rule sets "firefox" window to be tiled and does not change its virtual desktop.
rule = wm_class("emacs"), state(tiled), desktop(-1)

; Key Bindings:
; Define keyboard shortcuts to perform various actions.
; The syntax for defining key bindings is:
; bind = modifier + key -> action/function
; If two modifiers are used, combine them with a pipe (|). For example, alt + shift is written as alt|shift.
; Colon Syntax:
; Some functions require additional arguments to specify details of the action.
; These arguments are provided using a colon syntax, where the function and its argument
; are separated by a colon.
; Example: func(switch_desktop:1) means "switch to desktop 1".
; Example: func(resize:grow) means "grow the size of the window".
; Example: func(layout:master) means "toggle master layout".

; Available Modifiers:
; - super: The "Windows" key or "Command" key on a Mac.
; - alt: The "Alt" key.
; - shift: The "Shift" key.
; - ctr: The "Control" key.
;
; Available Actions:
; These actions specify what happens when a key binding is triggered.
; - run(...): Executes a specified process.
;   - Example: bind = super + return -> run("alacritty")
;   - To run a process with arguments, use a list:
;     Example: bind = super + p -> run(["rofi", "-show", "drun"])
;
; - func(...): Calls a predefined function. The following functions are available:
;   - kill: Kills the focused window.
;   - switch_desktop: Switches to a specified virtual desktop.
;   - fullscreen: Toggles fullscreen mode for the focused window.
;   - swap: Swaps the focused window with its sibling.
;   - transfer_node: Moves the focused window to another virtual desktop.
;   - layout: Toggles the specified layout (master, default, stack).
;   - traverse: (In stack layout only) Moves focus to the window above or below.
;   - flip: Changes the window's orientation; if the window is primarily vertical, it becomes horizontal, and vice versa.
;   - cycle_window: Moves focus to the window in the specified direction (up, down, left, right).
;   - cycle_desktop: Cycles through the virtual desktops (left, right).
;   - resize: Adjusts the size of the focused window (grow, shrink).
;   - reload_config: Reloads the configuration file without restarting ZWM.

; Define key bindings

; run processes on some keys
bind = super + return -> run("alacritty")
bind = super + space -> run("dmenu_run")
bind = super + p -> run(["rofi", "-show", "drun"])

; kill the focused window
bind = super + w -> func(kill)

; switch to specific virtual desktops
bind = super + 1 -> func(switch_desktop:1)
bind = super + 2 -> func(switch_desktop:2)
bind = super + 3 -> func(switch_desktop:3)
bind = super + 4 -> func(switch_desktop:4)
bind = super + 5 -> func(switch_desktop:5)
bind = super + 6 -> func(switch_desktop:6)
bind = super + 7 -> func(switch_desktop:7)

; resize the focused window
bind = super + l -> func(resize:grow)
bind = super + h -> func(resize:shrink)

; toggle fullscreen mode
bind = super + f -> func(fullscreen)

; swap the focused window with its sibling
bind = super + s -> func(swap)

; cycle focus between windows
bind = super + up -> func(cycle_window:up)
bind = super + right -> func(cycle_window:right)
bind = super + left -> func(cycle_window:left)
bind = super + down -> func(cycle_window:down)

; cycle through virtual desktops
bind = super|shift + left -> func(cycle_desktop:left)
bind = super|shift + right -> func(cycle_desktop:right)

; transfer the focused window to another virtual desktop
bind = super|shift + 1 -> func(transfer_node:1)
bind = super|shift + 2 -> func(transfer_node:2)
bind = super|shift + 3 -> func(transfer_node:3)
bind = super|shift + 4 -> func(transfer_node:4)
bind = super|shift + 5 -> func(transfer_node:5)
bind = super|shift + 6 -> func(transfer_node:6)
bind = super|shift + 7 -> func(transfer_node:7)

; change the layout
bind = super|shift + m -> func(layout:master)
bind = super|shift + s -> func(layout:stack)
bind = super|shift + d -> func(layout:default)

; traverse the stack layout
bind = super|shift + k -> func(traverse:up)
bind = super|shift + j -> func(traverse:down)

; flip the orientation of the window
bind = super|shift + f -> func(flip)

; reload the configuration file
bind = super|shift + r -> func(reload_config)
